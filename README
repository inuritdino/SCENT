scent_1.0 is an R-package for analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq data. 
It uses the notion of single-cell entropy to provide estimates of a cell's potency or phenotypic plasticity.
This estimate of potency can be used to order single-cells in pseudotime, or to identify novel stem-like phenotypes
in normal development or cancer.
In addition, SCENT provides a lineage-inference algorithm by using the estimated potencies to further subcluster single-cells.
